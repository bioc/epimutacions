# Introduction

## Background

Rare diseases are pathologies with a low prevalence (< 1 per 2,000 people). Most of these pathologies have an onset during childhood and a strong genetic etiology. Consequently, rare disease diagnosis has relied on identifying genetic and genomic mutations that can cause the disease. Although these variants have provided a diagnosis for many patients and families, around 60% of the cases remained undiagnosed [@lionel2018improved]. Aberrant methylation can be an underlying cause of undiagnosed patients, either as a primary event (a.k.a. epimutation) or as a functional consequence of chromatin dysregulation by genetic or environmental agents (a.k.a. episignature). Epimutations are the cause of some rare diseases, such as Prader-Willi, Angelman or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes [@aref2019] and some human malformations [@serra2015dna]. Syndrome-specific episignatures are increasingly defined as biomarkers for a growing number of disorders [@aref2019]. Therefore, tools to detect epimutations and episignatures should be made available to the rare disease community and included in standardized analysis workflows.


The package `epimutacions ` provides tools for analysing epivariants using multiple outlier detection  approaches. In addition, functions to plot and annotate 
the identified epimutations. The full `epimutacions ` user´s guide is available in this vignette. 
The main function to estimate the epivariants is called `epimutations()`. 

The name of the package is `epimutacions` (pronounced `ɛ pi mu ta 'sj ons`) which means epimutations in Catalan, a language from the northeast of Spain.

## Methodology

The `epimutacions` package computes a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to detect the epigenetic variants to be considered as biomarkers for samples with rare diseases (epimutations). The method compares a case sample with suspected rare disease against a reference panel.  The package focused on the detection of outliers in DNA methylation patterns associated with the diseases as proposed by [@aref2019].  

The identification of relevant genomic methylation regions for a given sample having a rare disease will be driven by detecting differentially methylated CpG sites when comparing beta values of all control samples with the given proband. Firstly, bump-hunter [@jaffe2012bump] approach is used to identify the Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs). After that, CpGs in the proband sample are tested in those DMRs in order to identify regions with CpGs being outliers when comparing with the reference panel. To this end, different anomaly detection statistical approaches are used. Those include multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) [@friedrich2017package], multivariate linear model [@martin2020multivariate], isolation forest [@cortes2021package] and robust mahalanobis distance [@maechler2021package]. However, Barbosa [@barbosa2018] and Beta methods do not use bump-hunter output. Barbosa [@barbosa2018] checks for each CpG, if the proband’s measurement is an outlier. Then, it calls an epimutation to those regions where 3 contiguous CpGs are outliers, and they are separated by less than 500 base pairs. Beta approach models the DNA methylation data using a beta distribution.  

## Input data

The package allows two different types of inputs: 

 * (1) `IDAT` files containing the case samples and `RGChannelSet` object as reference panel. The reference panel can be supplied by the user or can be selected through the example datasets that the package provides. 
 
* (2) `GenomicRatioSet` object containing case and control samples.  

In the first case, normalization through `epi_preprocess()` function is highly recommended. In order to remove the unwanted variation caused by the batch effect when combining data from different sources. As a result, `GenomicRatioSet` object will be obtained.  

Finally, these datasets are used as an input of  `epimutations()` function. It should be mentioned that  case samples and reference panel are introduced separately.

```

## Candidate regions

Epimutations detection has two main steps: (1) definition of candidate regions and (2) evaluation of outlier significance. Although there are different algorithms to define epimutations regions, they share common features. In general, we define an epimutation as at least 3 contiguous  CpGs with a maximum distance of 1kb between them.  

In Illumina 450K array, probes are unequally distributed along the genome, limiting the number of regions that can fulfill the requirements to be considered an epimutation. So, we have computed a dataset containing the regions that are candidates to become an epimutation.  

To define the candidate epimutations, we relied on the clustering from bumphunter. We defined a primary dataset with all the CpGs from the Illumina 450K array.  Then, we run bumphunter and selected those regions with at least 3 CpGs. As a result, we found 40408 candidate epimutations which are available in `candRegsGR` dataset. The code for generating these regions can be found in epimutacion package. 

In addition, we converted the candidate region from hg19 to hg38 coordinates, using NCBI remap. We selected regions that mapped to one region in hg38 with the same length. This yielded a total of 39944, the 98.85% of total hg19 regions. After converting to hg38, we can use these ranges to be annotated to ENCODE cREs. Overall, we mapped 30163 candidate regions to cREs, representing 74.65% of total candidate regions.

# Setup

## Installing the package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("epimutacions")
```


## Loading libraries

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(epimutacions)
```

## Preparing dataset


The package includes a small `GenomicRatioSet` class dataset (`methy` `r data("methy", package = "epimutacions")`) containing the DNA methylation profiles from a total of  `r ncol(methy)` individuals, `r ncol(methy[,methy$status == "case"])` cases and `r ncol(methy[,methy$status == "control"])` controls. The DNA methylation profiles were generated using the Illumina 450k Human Methylation BeadChip. The data were obtained from [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and adapted for the package usage. 


```{r}
data("methy")
methy

table(methy$status)
```

We are going to create two different datasets for further analysis, `case_samples` and `control_panel`: 
```{r}
case_samples <- methy[,methy$status == "case"]
control_samples <- methy[,methy$status == "control"]
```

The default settings for each method can be obtained by invoking  the function `norm_parameters()` with no arguments:

```{r}
norm_parameters()
```

However, to modify the parameters related to a  method you can do as the following example for `illumina` approach:

```{r}
parameters <- norm_parameters(illumina = list("bg.correct" = FALSE))
parameters$illumina$bg.correct
```

# Epimutations

## Epimutations detection

The `epimutacions` package includes 6 methods for epivariants identification: (1) Multivariate Analysis of variance (`manova`), (2) Multivariate Linear Model (`mlm`), (3) isolation forest (`isoforest`), (4) robust mahalanobis distance  (`mahdistmcd`) (5) `barbosa` and (6) `beta`. 


In the mentioned first 4 methods, firstly, Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) are identified using bump-hunter method [@jaffe2012bump]. Then, those DMRs are tested to identify regions with CpGs being outliers when comparing with the reference panel. However, `barbosa` and `beta` do not identify outliers by filtering the DMRs. `barbosa`  utilized a sliding window approach to individually compare the methylation value  in each proband against the referece panel. `Beta` used beta distribution to identify epivariants in the case sample. 


```{r, epi_mvo, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
epi_mvo <- epimutations(case_samples, control_samples, method = "manova")
epi_ml <- epimutations(case_samples, control_samples, method = "mlm")
epi_iso <- epimutations(case_samples, control_samples, method = "isoforest")
epi_mcd <- epimutations(case_samples, control_samples, method = "mahdistmcd")
```


```{r, epi_beta, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
epi_brb <- epimutations(case_samples, control_samples, method = "barbosa")
epi_beta <- epimutations(case_samples, control_samples, method = "beta")

```


## Unique parameters

The `epi_parameters()` function  is  useful to set the value of the parameters for the above methods. 
In the following table each argument is described: 

+---------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Method        | Parameter                   | Description                                                          |
+===============+=============================+======================================================================+
| `manova`<br>  | `pvalue_cutoff`             | The threshold p-value to select which CpG regions are outliers       |
|  `mlm`<br>    |                             |                                                                      |
|  `beta`       |                             |                                                                      |
+---------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `iso.forest`  | `outlier_score_cutoff`<br>  | The threshold to select which CpG regions are outliers<br>           |
|               | `ntrees`                    | The number of binary trees to build for the model                    |
+---------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|`mahdist.mcd`  | `nsamp`                     | The number of subsets used for initial estimates in the MCD          |
+---------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  `barbosa`    |`window_sz`<br>              |The maximum distance between CpGs to be considered in the same DMR<br>|                
|               |`offset_mean`/`offset_abs`   | The upper and lower threshold to consider a CpG an outlier           |
+---------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `beta`        | `pvalue_cutoff`<br>         | The minimum p-value to consider a CpG an outlier<br>                 |
|               | `diff_threshold`            | The minimum methylation difference between the CpG and the           |
|               |                             |  mean methylation to consider a position an outlier                  |
+---------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Invoking `epi_parameters()` with no arguments returns a list of the default settings for each method: 

```{r}
epi_parameters()
```

If we want to change the p-value cut off for `manova` we can do as following: 

```{r}
parameters <- epi_parameters(manova = list("pvalue_cutoff" = 0.01))
parameters$manova$pvalue_cutoff
```


## Results description

The two methods from literature returned `r nrow(epi_brb)` and `r nrow(epi_mvo)` epimutations as we can see:

```{r, show_brb_mvo_1}
nrow(epi_brb) # Results from Barbosa et. al. 2018
nrow(epi_mvo) # Results from Aref-Eshghi et. al. 2019
```

All the implemented methods return the same `tibble` although the meaning of some of the columns is slightly different. Let's see one of the outputs from the two methods from literature:

```{r, show_brb_mvo_2}
rbind(epi_brb[1, ], epi_mvo[1, ])
```

## Epimutations annotations

The `epimutacions` package also includes the `annotate_epimutations` function dedicated to enrich the epimutations identified by the previously described methods:

```{r, ann, message=FALSE, tidy = TRUE}
rst_mvo <- annotate_epimutations(epi_mvo)
```

```{r ann results, eval = FALSE}
rst_mvo[1:2, c(1, 12:14)]
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(rst_mvo[1:2, c(1, 12:14)], caption = "epimutations annotation")
```


## Epimutation visualization

The  visualization approach locates the epimutations along the genome. The function `plot_epimutations` plots the methylation values of the  individual with the epimutation in red, the control samples in dashed black lines and population mean in blue:  
```{r}
plot_epimutations(as.data.frame(epi_mvo[1,]), methy)
```

Furthermore, it includes the gene annotations in the regions in which the epivariation is located.  This can be achieved by using the argument  `gene_annot == TRUE`: 

```{r, plot_mvo_genes_annot}
plot_epimutations(as.data.frame(epi_mvo[1,]), methy, genes_annot = TRUE)
```


Also, it is possible to plot the chromatin marks H3K4me3, H3K27me3  and H3K27ac by setting the argument `regulation = TRUE`:

* **H3K4me3**: commonly associated with the activation of transcription of nearby genes.
* **H3K27me3**: is used in epigenetics to look for inactive genes.
* **H3K27ac**: is associated with the higher activation of transcription and therefore defined as an active enhancer mark


```{r, plot_mvo_regulation}
plot_epimutations(as.data.frame(epi_mvo[1,]), methy, regulation = TRUE)
```
